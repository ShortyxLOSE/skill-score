skill-score
======
Skill-score is an application that enables Mycroft to answer user questions about Major League Baseball (MLB) scores. [Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai) is an open-source AI voice assistant. Skill-score uses [panzarino's mlbgame API](https://github.com/panzarino/mlbgame) to report an MLB team's latest final scores, including live scores. 

The next goals for skill-score are the ability to: 
* give the time of the next MLB game; and
* support more leagues (e.g., National Football League, National Basketball League), depending on available APIs.

## Examples 
* "what is the Royals score"
