## score
Reports the score of an MLB game.

## Description 
Uses [panzarino's mlbgame API](https://github.com/panzarino/mlbgame) to report latest score (including live) for an MLB team.
Tries for live score, otherwise gets latest final score for the team in question.

Next goal is to add intent handling for asking what time a game starts (e.g. later that day)
Then add more leagues (NFL, NBA, NHL, MLS) depending on available APIs.

## Examples 
* "what is the Royals score"
